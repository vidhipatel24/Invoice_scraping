  "description": "You developed an automation for a process that scraped relevant data from the invoices for further processing. The Robot read through emails and download the invoices received in the form of an email attachment as a PDF. It extracted specific data and stored those values in an Excel spreadsheet and a subset of values was uploaded to the Orchestrator Queue. And finally you had the robot emailed the spreadsheet to yourself when it completed the rest of the automation.",
